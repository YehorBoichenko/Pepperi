Pair List Manager

Link to the working DEMO:

Pair List Manager is a simple web app for managing a list of key-value pairs. It allows users to add, delete, and sort pairs by name or value, as well as convert the list to XML format.

Usage
To use Pair List Manager, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The app will load and display an empty list of pairs.

Adding Pairs
To add a pair to the list, enter the key and value separated by an equals sign (=) in the "Add Pair" input field and click the "Add" button. The pair will be added to the end of the list.

Deleting Pairs
To delete the last pair in the list, click the "Delete" button. If the list is empty, an error message will be displayed.

Sorting Pairs
To sort the list by name or value, click the "Sort by Name" or "Sort by Value" button, respectively. The list will be sorted in ascending order based on the selected criterion.

Converting to XML
To convert the list to XML format, click the "Show XML" button. Each pair will be displayed in XML format, with the key enclosed in <name> tags and the value enclosed in <value> tags.
